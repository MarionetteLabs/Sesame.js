### Technologies + Motivations

#### Simple Sub Views

Minionette has great region support, which will support layouts and lists. Why Minionette Regions?
+ simpler API
+ DOM replacement - no extra elements
+ decidedly not a view


---
#### Better DOM updates

The world has changed and people want to update the DOM in an incremental fashion.

IDOM + JSX support will do that.


---
#### Routing with a state engine

Routes should be a core architecture that encourages componentization.

---
#### Classes

Backbone.Metal offers classes and mixins that will make it easier to build out re-usable core layer.


### Why Sesame?

In addition to our love of sesame bagels, Sesame Street is a collection of some of the most loveable puppets around. Who wouldn't go for that.
